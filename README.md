# CPU Simulator

A terminal-based CPU simulator that executes an extended subset of assembly instructions. This simulator mimics the functionality of a basic CPU, including components like ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), registers, and control units. It simulates instruction fetch, decode, and execute cycles, supporting a set of assembly instructions like ADD, SUB, MOV, LOAD, STORE, and more.

## Features
- Simulates basic CPU architecture.
- Supports a subset of assembly instructions.
- 8 registers for storing data.
- Simulates 256 bytes of memory.
- ALU for arithmetic operations.
- Supports user-defined assembly instructions.

## Instructions Set
- **ADD**: Adds two values.
- **SUB**: Subtracts two values.
- **MOV**: Moves data between registers.
- **LOAD**: Loads data from memory into a register.
- **STORE**: Stores data from a register to memory.
- **START**: Starts the CPU simulation.
- **EXIT**: Exits the simulation.
- **DISC**: Discards changes made to the memory.
- **LAYO**: A custom instruction for specific actions.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Terminal or command line interface
